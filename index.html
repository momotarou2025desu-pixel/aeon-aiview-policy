  <h1>Privacy Policy (AeonAIView)</h1>
  <div class="muted"><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2025-12-29</div>

  <h2>1. Who we are (Controller / App Provider)</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how the app provider (“we”, “us”) handles information in connection with
    <strong>AeonAIView</strong> (the “App”).
  </p>
  <p>
    Contact: <a href="mailto:momotarou2025desu@gmail.com">momotarou2025desu@gmail.com</a>
  </p>

  <h2>2. What the App does</h2>
  <p>
    AeonAIView is a launcher that helps you open AI service websites in an external browser
    (e.g., Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox).
  </p>
  <p>
    The App does not provide its own login system. Account login status, cookies, browsing history, and content you enter
    on websites (including chat content) are handled by the external browser and the third-party websites you visit.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Responsibility boundary (important)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Our responsibility:</strong> information we directly process inside the App (if any) as described in this policy.
      The App does not run our own backend server for user accounts.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Third-party responsibility:</strong> (a) advertising providers (e.g., Google/AdMob) and
      (b) the websites you visit and the external browser you use.
      Their data handling is governed by their own policies.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Information we collect directly</h2>
  <p>
    The App does not require you to create an account and does not directly collect personal information such as
    your name, email address, or phone number.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not directly collect or store your website login credentials or your chat content.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Advertising (Google AdMob / Google Mobile Ads SDK)</h2>
  <p>
    The App may display ads provided by third-party advertising services (for example, Google AdMob / Google Mobile Ads SDK).
    Those providers (and their partners) may automatically collect, use, and share certain information for ad delivery,
    measurement, analytics, and fraud prevention.
  </p>

  <h3>Examples of information that may be processed by ad providers</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>IP address</strong> (may be used to estimate general location)</li>
    <li><strong>Advertising ID</strong> and other device identifiers</li>
    <li><strong>App activity / ad interactions</strong> (e.g., app launches, ad impressions, taps/clicks)</li>
    <li><strong>Diagnostics / performance data</strong> (e.g., crash logs)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Your ad choices</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>You can reset or delete your Android Advertising ID in device settings.</li>
    <li>You can manage ad personalization and privacy controls in Android/Google settings.</li>
    <li>Where required by law, ads may be shown only after you provide consent (and you can change your choice later).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Google policy</h3>
  <p>
    Google Privacy Policy:
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>
  </p>

  <h2>6. Legal bases (EEA/UK/Switzerland, where applicable)</h2>
  <p>
    Where applicable, we rely on legitimate interests to operate the App as a launcher. For personalized advertising or
    similar processing, we (or the relevant ad provider) may rely on consent where required by law.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Data sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell your personal information as part of operating AeonAIView.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ad-related information may be shared by ad providers with their partners for ad delivery, measurement, analytics, and
    fraud prevention, according to their policies.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Data retention</h2>
  <p>
    The App does not maintain user accounts and does not store your chat content on our servers.
    Ad providers and third-party websites may retain data according to their own retention practices.
  </p>

  <h2>9. International data transfers</h2>
  <p>
    Because the App uses third-party services and websites that may operate globally, information processed by those
    third parties may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your own, according to their policies.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take reasonable measures to protect the App. Third-party SDKs and websites may transmit data using encryption in
    transit as part of their standard operation.
  </p>

  <h2>11. Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is not intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
  </p>

  <h2>12. Your rights</h2>
  <p>
    Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, delete, or object to certain processing.
    Because most data is processed by third parties (ad providers, external browser, and visited websites),
    requests may need to be directed to those providers. You can contact us at the email above and we will
    guide you to the relevant party where appropriate.
  </p>

  <h2>13. Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this policy from time to time. The latest version will be published on this page with an updated date.
