      <h2>1. AI Launcher Features</h2>
      <p>
        AI Launcher is a launcher app that can open selected AI service websites in an external browser
        (such as Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
        AI Launcher does not provide its own login system. Login status, cookies, browsing history, and any
        content you enter on those websites are handled by your external browser and the third-party websites
        you access.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2>2. One-time In-app Purchase</h2>
      <p>AI Launcher does not display ads.</p>
      <p>
        This app offers a one-time in-app purchase to continue using the app after the trial period ends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Payment processing is handled by Google Play. We do not obtain or store payment information such as
        credit card details.

        AI Launcher does not collect or store website login credentials or chat content on our servers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The app stores information such as the trial start time, the last date the guidance message was shown,
        and the purchase status (unlock flag) on your device to operate. This information is not sent to our
        servers.

        We only receive the purchase result (e.g., whether you have purchased). We do not retain payment details.
