  <h2>1. Summary</h2>
  <p>AeonAIView is a launcher that opens AI service websites in an external browser. The app itself does not provide login or account management.</p>

  <h2>2. Advertising</h2>
  <p>This app displays ads provided by Google (e.g., AdMob / Google Mobile Ads SDK).</p>

  <h2>3. Information Collected</h2>
  <p>AeonAIView does not ask you to create an account and does not directly collect personal information like your name, email address, or phone number.</p>
  <p>However, the advertising SDK may automatically collect and share certain information for advertising, analytics, and fraud prevention, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>IP address</strong> (may be used to estimate general location)</li>
    <li><strong>Device and account identifiers</strong> (including Android Advertising ID and other identifiers, if applicable)</li>
    <li><strong>User product interactions</strong> (e.g., app launch, taps, video views)</li>
    <li><strong>Diagnostic information</strong> (e.g., crash logs / performance data)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. How the App Uses Information</h2>
  <p>The app’s main function is to open selected websites in an external browser. Any login state, cookies, and browsing history are managed by the external browser and the third-party websites you visit.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>Ad-related data may be shared with Google and its advertising partners as part of ad delivery, measurement, analytics, and fraud prevention.</p>

  <h2>6. Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can reset or delete your Android Advertising ID in your device settings.</li>
    <li>You can manage ad personalization and privacy controls in Android settings and in Google’s ad settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Security</h2>
  <p>Data transmitted by the advertising SDK may be encrypted in transit (e.g., via TLS) as part of the SDK’s standard behavior.</p>

  <h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Websites opened from AeonAIView are third-party services. Their data practices are governed by their own privacy policies.</p>
  <p>Google privacy policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></p>

  <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>This app is not intended to knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

  <h2>10. Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. The latest version will be published at the URL shown on the app’s store listing.</p>
