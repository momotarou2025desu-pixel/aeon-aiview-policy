  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>
    AeonAIView is a launcher application that helps you open selected AI service websites in an external browser
    (for example, Chrome, Microsoft Edge, or Firefox).
  </p>
  <p>
    AeonAIView does not provide its own login system. Account login status, cookies, browsing history, and other
    website data are managed by your chosen external browser and the third-party websites you visit.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Advertising</h2>
  <p>
    AeonAIView may display advertisements provided by third-party advertising services (e.g., Google AdMob).
  </p>

  <h2>3. Information Collected</h2>
  <p>
    AeonAIView does not require you to create an account and does not directly collect personal information such as
    your name, email address, or phone number.
  </p>
  <p>
    This app may include third-party advertising services (e.g., Google AdMob). Any information handling related to
    ad delivery and measurement is performed in accordance with the privacy policies of those advertising providers.
    For details, please review each provider’s policy.

  <h2>4. Permissions</h2>

    AeonAIView does not request sensitive permissions such as access to contacts, phone/SMS, microphone, camera,
    or precise location. If future versions require additional permissions, we will update this policy and
    explain why they are needed.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Websites</h2>
  <p>
    Websites opened from AeonAIView are third-party services. Their data practices are governed by their own
    privacy policies. Please review the privacy policies of the websites and the external browser you use.
  </p>
