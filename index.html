  <h1>Privacy Policy (AeonAIView)</h1>
  <div class="muted"><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2025-12-29</div>

  <h2>1. What AeonAIView does</h2>
  <p>
    AeonAIView is a launcher app that helps you open selected AI service websites in an external browser
    (for example, Chrome, Microsoft Edge, or Firefox).
  </p>
  <p>
    AeonAIView does not provide its own login system. Login status, cookies, browsing history, and any content you enter
    on those websites are handled by the external browser and the third-party websites you visit.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Advertising</h2>
  <p>
    AeonAIView may include third-party advertising services (for example, Google AdMob), and ads may be displayed in the app.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Information we collect</h2>
  <p>
    AeonAIView does not require you to create an account and does not directly collect personal information such as your name,
    email address, or phone number.
  </p>
  <p>
    AeonAIView does not collect or store your website login credentials or your chat content on our servers.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Information handled by ad providers</h2>
  <p>
    When ads are shown, third-party advertising services used in the app (for example, Google AdMob / Google Mobile Ads SDK)
    may automatically collect, use, and share certain information for ad delivery, measurement, improvement, analytics,
    and fraud prevention. Examples may include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>IP address</strong> (which may be used to estimate general location)</li>
    <li><strong>Advertising ID</strong> and other device identifiers</li>
    <li><strong>App activity and ad interactions</strong> (e.g., app launches, ad impressions, taps/clicks)</li>
    <li><strong>Diagnostics and performance data</strong> (e.g., crash logs)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. How the information is used</h2>
  <p>The information described above may be used for purposes such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Displaying and delivering ads</li>
    <li>Measuring ad performance (impressions, clicks, and where applicable, conversions)</li>
    <li>Analytics and service improvement</li>
    <li>Detecting, preventing, and addressing fraud or abuse</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Data sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell your personal information.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ad-related information may be shared by advertising providers with their partners as part of ad delivery, measurement,
    analytics, and fraud prevention processes, in accordance with their privacy policies.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Your choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can reset or delete your Android Advertising ID in your device settings.</li>
    <li>You can manage ad personalization and related privacy controls in Android and Google settings.</li>
    <li>You can review and manage device permissions and privacy settings at any time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Permissions</h2>
  <p>
    AeonAIView does not request sensitive permissions such as access to contacts, phone/SMS, microphone, camera, or precise location.
  </p>
  <p>
    If future versions require additional permissions, we will update this policy and explain why those permissions are needed.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Third-party websites and services</h2>
  <p>
    Websites opened from AeonAIView are third-party services. Their data practices are governed by their own privacy policies.
    Please review the privacy policies of the websites you use and the external browser you choose.
