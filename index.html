  <h1>AI Launcher Privacy Policy (by iogusnohin)</h1>
  <p class="meta">Last updated: 2026-01-22</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    “AI Launcher” (the “App”) is a launcher application that opens selected AI services and other websites
    in your device’s external web browser (e.g., Chrome, Edge).
    This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles information.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <p>The App does not collect or send the following information to the developer’s servers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Personal information such as your name, address, phone number, or email address</li>
    <li>Login credentials (IDs, passwords, etc.)</li>
    <li>Content you enter on websites opened in your external browser (e.g., chat messages)</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="note">
    <strong>Note:</strong>
    When you use third-party websites in your external browser, any login, input, cookies, browsing history, and related data
    are handled by your browser and the website provider under their own policies.
  </div>

  <h2>3. Information Stored on Your Device</h2>
  <p>The App may store the following information on your device only, to operate the App:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Trial-related information (e.g., trial start time)</li>
    <li>In-app guidance/tutorial display status</li>
    <li>Purchase status information (e.g., whether the App is unlocked)</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="note">
    The above information is stored <strong>only on your device</strong> and is not uploaded to the developer’s servers.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Purposes of Use</h2>
  <p>The information stored on your device is used for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Managing the trial period</li>
    <li>Applying usage restrictions based on purchase status</li>
    <li>Providing screens and in-app guidance</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Sharing / Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The App does not send the information stored on your device to the developer’s servers and does not sell personal information.
  </p>
  <p>However, the following actions involve third-party services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Network communication, display, and input on websites opened in your external browser (managed by your browser and the website provider)</li>
    <li>In-app purchase processing (handled by Google Play)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. In-App Purchases (One-Time Purchase)</h2>
  <p>
    The App offers a one-time purchase. Payment is processed by Google Play, and the developer does not receive or store
    your credit card information. The App may check your purchase status and may store purchase status on your device as needed.
