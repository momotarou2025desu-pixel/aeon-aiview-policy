  <h1>Privacy Policy (AeonAIView)</h1>
  <div class="muted"><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2025-12-29</div>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>
    AeonAIView is a launcher application that helps you open selected AI service websites in an external browser
    (for example, Chrome, Microsoft Edge, or Firefox).
  </p>
  <p>
    AeonAIView does not provide its own login system. Account login status, cookies, browsing history, and other
    website data are managed by your chosen external browser and the third-party websites you visit.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Advertising</h2>
  <p>
    AeonAIView displays advertisements provided by Google and its advertising services
    (e.g., AdMob / Google Mobile Ads SDK).
  </p>

  <h2>3. Information Collected</h2>
  <p>
    AeonAIView does not require you to create an account and does not directly collect personal information such as
    your name, email address, or phone number.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, third-party advertising services used in the app (e.g., Google AdMob / Google Mobile Ads SDK) may
    automatically collect, use, and share certain information to provide, measure, and improve ads, as well as
    for analytics and fraud prevention. This may include, for example:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>IP address</strong> (which may be used to estimate general location)</li>
    <li><strong>Advertising ID and other device identifiers</strong></li>
    <li><strong>App activity and interaction data</strong> (e.g., app launches, ad impressions, taps/clicks)</li>
    <li><strong>Diagnostic and performance data</strong> (e.g., crash logs)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. How Information Is Used</h2>
  <p>
    The information described above may be used for purposes such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Displaying and delivering ads</li>
    <li>Measuring ad performance (impressions, clicks, conversions where applicable)</li>
    <li>Analytics and service improvement</li>
    <li>Detecting, preventing, and addressing fraud or abuse</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    Ad-related data may be shared with Google and its advertising partners as part of ad delivery, measurement,
    analytics, and fraud prevention processes. AeonAIView itself does not sell your personal information.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can reset or delete your Android Advertising ID in your device settings.</li>
    <li>You can manage ad personalization and related privacy controls in Android and Google settings.</li>
    <li>You can also review and manage permissions and privacy settings on your device at any time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Permissions</h2>
  <p>
    AeonAIView does not request sensitive permissions such as access to contacts, phone/SMS, microphone, camera,
    or precise location. If future versions require additional permissions, we will update this policy and
    explain why they are needed.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Third-Party Websites and Services</h2>
  <p>
    Websites opened from AeonAIView are third-party services. Their data practices are governed by their own
    privacy policies. Please review the privacy policies of the websites and the external browser you use.
